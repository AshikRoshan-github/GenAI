The Python code uses Langchain, Apify, and a vector database to answer questions based on crawled website content. Here's a breakdown of the architecture:

1. Environment Setup:

Process: Sets environment variables for OpenAI and Apify API keys. These are necessary for authenticating with the respective services.

2. Website Crawling (Apify):

Input: A starting URL (https://www.gadgets360.com/mobile-recharge-plans/airtel-prepaid) is provided as input to the Apify website-content-crawler actor.

Process: The ApifyWrapper is used to call the Apify actor. The actor crawls the given URL and extracts text content from the web page(s). A dataset_mapping_function transforms the crawled data into Langchain Document objects, storing the page content and the source URL as metadata.

Output: A Langchain DocumentLoader object (specifically, an instance of ApifyDatasetLoader which is returned by call_actor) containing the crawled website content as a list of Document objects.

3. Index Creation (Langchain):

Input: The DocumentLoader from the previous step.

Process:

VectorstoreIndexCreator creates a vector database index. It takes the DocumentLoader as input.

Behind the scenes, this involves:

Splitting the documents into chunks if needed.

Creating embeddings (vector representations) of the text chunks using a language model (likely backed by OpenAI, as indicated by the API key).

Storing these embeddings and the associated text chunks in a vector database.

Output: A VectorStore index object. This object allows efficient similarity searches.

4. Querying (Langchain):

Input: A user query ("What is airtel recharge plan available?").

Process:

The query_with_sources method of the index is called with the user query.

The query is embedded (converted into a vector) using the same language model as in step 3.

The vector database performs a similarity search to find the most relevant text chunks based on the query embedding.

The relevant chunks, along with their source URLs (from the metadata), are retrieved.

Output: A dictionary containing the answer and the sources used to generate the answer.

5. Print Results:

Input: The dictionary returned from the query.

Process: The code prints the generated answer and the source URLs to the console.
